 [INST] Please analyze the following document chunk and identify any relevant information related
        to the issue of water management. Include key points, important details, and any context that can contribute to the comprehensive summary

Document Chunk: iii) promoting new water sources; iv) promoting participatory management of water resources; and iv) raising public awareness
about water consumption. The TNC identifies surface water mobilisation as an important goal for Djibouti, which is already a focus
of several planned and implemented studies on reservoirs, excavations, buried tanks and dams. In addition, the TNC highlights the
benefits of the integrated water resource management (IWRM) approach, which enhances coordinated management of water and
associated resources to maximise economic and social well-being sustainably and equitably. While it is noted that IWRM does not
offer a single solution and should be developed in the local context, lessons learned and best practices can be leveragedEnsuring
water availability and access and supporting participatory management of water resources have been identified as national priorities
in the country. The proposed project will address this by enhancing water resource management and installing grey infrastructure
for improved water access in rural Djiboutian communities (Outcome 2.1).

        to the issue of water management. Include key points, important details, and any context that can contribute to the comprehensive summary

Document Chunk: sustainable water resource management interventions to improve access to water and increase the availability of
groundwater through better recharge mechanisms in Djibouti[108]108. These limitations constrain access to and availability
of water resources by rural communities, thereby promoting water insecurity in the country.
Barrier 5. Current water access infrastructure is insufficient for communities’ needs in the face of climate
change conditions.
40. Current diesel-powered water pumps are insufficient for community needs as: i) diesel is expensive, susceptible to price
fluctuations and not readily available; and ii) pumps are not guaranteed to function during or after drought and flooding
events. The low resilience of the current water infrastructure leads to decreased water accessibility for rural communities
exposed to drought and flooding events.
5/31/2023 Page 31 of 66 [/INST]  Based on the provided document chunk, here is the analysis related to the issue of water management:
Key Points:
* Water security is limited in Djibouti due to various barriers, including insufficiency of water access infrastructure, lack of reliable energy sources, and vulnerability to climate change impacts.
* Currently, there are only 17 operational wells serving over 1 million people in Djibouti, resulting in uneven distribution of water resources.
* Groundwater is the primary source of water supply in Djibouti, but its availability is threatened by climate change, population growth, and poor management practices.
Important Details:
* The country faces challenges in managing its scarce water resources due to factors such as high evaporation rates, limited rainfall, and increasing demand from growing populations.
* Climate change poses significant risks to Djibouti's water resources, including sea level rise, changes in precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events like droughts and floods.
Context:
* Djibouti is located in the Horn of Africa, where water scarcity is

Document Chunk: through evapotranspiration from temporary pools or rivers following rainfall events. As a result of the limited surface
water, the country relies on groundwater, which accounts for ~95% of its water supply, including that used for pastoralism
and crop irrigation. Aquifer recharge is slow and occurs primarily during flooding events by absorption through the wadi
riverbeds. Consequently, only 5% of rainfall in the country contributes to groundwater recharge through infiltration[17]19.
9. The extraction of groundwater in Djibouti is frequently challenging — obstacles include the depth of the aquifers (usually
beyond 100m) and the elevated temperatures of extracted water, which can reach up to 80°C. As a result of these high
temperatures, aquifer water is generally pumped directly into stone or cement reservoirs to allow it to cool before use. In
rural areas, there is limited piped infrastructure, partially as a result of the sparse distribution of households. In such areas,
groundwater is accessed through deep boreholes or superficial wells and then pumped into reservoirs, from where many

Key Points:
* Water scarcity is a significant challenge in Djibouti due to limited surface water resources, resulting in reliance on groundwater for nearly all water needs.
* Groundwater accounts for approximately 95% of Djibouti's total water supply, including for pastoralism and crop irrigation.
* Only about 5% of rainfall in Djibouti contributes to groundwater recharge through infiltration, mainly occurring during flooding events.
Important Details:
* Evapotranspiration from temporary pools or rivers after rainfall events further reduces available surface water resources.
* Deep boreholes or shallow wells are commonly used in rural areas to access groundwater, followed by direct pumping into storage tanks or reservoirs to reduce temperature-related issues.
Contextual Information:
* Djibouti's arid climate and limited surface water resources make water management crucial for sustainable development.
* The country faces challenges

Document Chunk: measures and responsibilities necessary for preventing the over-abstraction of groundwater resources. Fuel-powered
borehole pumps will be replaced with solar-powered pumps. In addition, the infrastructure will accommodate geothermal
conditions in Djibouti and include the necessary cooling reservoirs in sites where groundwater is extremely hot.
Groundwater access will be complemented with surface and sub-surface water catchment infrastructure (Output 3.2). As
with the boreholes in Output 3.2, a community needs assessment will be undertaken to determine site-specific
interventions. Catchment points for surface water will include infrastructure proven effective within the target areas,
including microdams or underground storage tanks. Site specific interventions will be determined based on evaluations
done during the PGG phase. The hydrological and groundwater assessments conducted will be made available via the
knowledge management platform to national policy-makers and project developers to improve the limited understanding of
groundwater systems and upscale sustainable integrated water resource management techniques in Djibouti. Output 3.3
will further manage the impacts of surface water on downstream areas by protecting against flood damage and erosion.
Methods for preventing floods may include infiltration galleries[2]111 and gabions. Site-specific interventions will be
determined based on the topography and community-specific impacts identified during the PPG phase. To build on the
limited water resource management information in the country, the proposed project will support gender-responsive,
evidence-based development by producing assessments on: i) sustainable groundwater access points; ii) surface and sub-
surface storage and catchment points; and iii) rangeland and oasis ecosystems restoration. [/INST]  Based on the provided document chunk, here is the analysis related to the issue of water management:
