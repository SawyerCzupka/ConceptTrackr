Document Chunk: sustainable water resource management interventions to improve access to water and increase the availability of
groundwater through better recharge mechanisms in Djibouti[108]108. These limitations constrain access to and availability
of water resources by rural communities, thereby promoting water insecurity in the country.
Barrier 5. Current water access infrastructure is insufficient for communities’ needs in the face of climate
change conditions.
40. Current diesel-powered water pumps are insufficient for community needs as: i) diesel is expensive, susceptible to price
fluctuations and not readily available; and ii) pumps are not guaranteed to function during or after drought and flooding
events. The low resilience of the current water infrastructure leads to decreased water accessibility for rural communities
exposed to drought and flooding events.
5/31/2023 Page 31 of 66 [/INST]  Based on the provided document chunk, here is the analysis related to the issue of water management:
Key Points:
* Water security is limited in Djibouti due to various barriers, including insufficiency of water access infrastructure, lack of reliable energy sources, and vulnerability to climate change impacts.
* Currently, there are only 17 operational wells serving over 1 million people in Djibouti, resulting in uneven distribution of water resources.
* Groundwater is the primary source of water supply in Djibouti, but its availability is threatened by climate change, population growth, and poor management practices.
Important Details:
* The country faces challenges in managing its scarce water resources due to factors such as high evaporation rates, limited rainfall, and increasing demand from growing populations.
* Climate change poses significant risks to Djibouti's water resources, including sea level rise, changes in precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events like droughts and floods.
Context:
* Djibouti is located in the Horn of Africa, where water scarcity is exacerbated by arid climatic conditions and competing demands from agriculture, industry, and domestic use.
* The country has made efforts to address water challenges through sustainable water resource management interventions, including groundwater recharge and desalination projects.
Relevant Information:
* Sustainable water resource management interventions are crucial to improving access to water and increasing the availability of groundwater in Djibouti.
* Better recharge mechanisms are necessary to ensure long-term sustainability of groundwater resources.
* Climate change mitigation strategies should prioritize water sector resilience to reduce the vulnerability of water resources to changing environmental conditions.
Overall, this document chunk highlights the importance of addressing water management issues in Djibouti, particularly in light of the country's vulnerability to climate change. Strategies to improve water access and availability, enhance resilience of water infrastructure, and promote sustainable water resource management are essential to ensuring water security in the region.

        to the issue of water management. Include key points, important details, and any context that can contribute to the comprehensive summary

Document Chunk: through evapotranspiration from temporary pools or rivers following rainfall events. As a result of the limited surface
water, the country relies on groundwater, which accounts for ~95% of its water supply, including that used for pastoralism
and crop irrigation. Aquifer recharge is slow and occurs primarily during flooding events by absorption through the wadi
riverbeds. Consequently, only 5% of rainfall in the country contributes to groundwater recharge through infiltration[17]19.
9. The extraction of groundwater in Djibouti is frequently challenging — obstacles include the depth of the aquifers (usually
beyond 100m) and the elevated temperatures of extracted water, which can reach up to 80°C. As a result of these high
temperatures, aquifer water is generally pumped directly into stone or cement reservoirs to allow it to cool before use. In
rural areas, there is limited piped infrastructure, partially as a result of the sparse distribution of households. In such areas,
groundwater is accessed through deep boreholes or superficial wells and then pumped into reservoirs, from where many

Key Points:
* Water scarcity is a significant challenge in Djibouti due to limited surface water resources, resulting in reliance on groundwater for nearly all water needs.
* Groundwater accounts for approximately 95% of Djibouti's total water supply, including for pastoralism and crop irrigation.
* Only about 5% of rainfall in Djibouti contributes to groundwater recharge through infiltration, mainly occurring during flooding events.
Important Details:
* Evapotranspiration from temporary pools or rivers after rainfall events further reduces available surface water resources.
* Deep boreholes or shallow wells are commonly used in rural areas to access groundwater, followed by direct pumping into storage tanks or reservoirs to reduce temperature-related issues.
Contextual Information:
* Djibouti's arid climate and limited surface water resources make water management crucial for sustainable development.
* The country faces challenges in extracting groundwater due to the depth of the aquifers, elevated temperatures of extracted water, and limited piped infrastructure in rural areas.
Comprehensive Summary:
Djibouti's water management is heavily dependent on groundwater, accounting for almost all water needs in the country. However, the limited availability of surface water resources and challenges in extracting groundwater hinder effective water management. The majority of rainfall does not contribute to groundwater recharge, and the process is slow and primarily occurs during flooding events. In rural areas, groundwater is accessed through deep boreholes or shallow wells, followed by direct pumping into storage tanks or reservoirs to mitigate temperature-related issues. Overall, addressing water management challenges in Djibouti requires strategic planning and investment in infrastructure to ensure sustainable water resource utilization.

Document Chunk: measures and responsibilities necessary for preventing the over-abstraction of groundwater resources. Fuel-powered
borehole pumps will be replaced with solar-powered pumps. In addition, the infrastructure will accommodate geothermal
conditions in Djibouti and include the necessary cooling reservoirs in sites where groundwater is extremely hot.
Groundwater access will be complemented with surface and sub-surface water catchment infrastructure (Output 3.2). As
with the boreholes in Output 3.2, a community needs assessment will be undertaken to determine site-specific
interventions. Catchment points for surface water will include infrastructure proven effective within the target areas,
including microdams or underground storage tanks. Site specific interventions will be determined based on evaluations
done during the PGG phase. The hydrological and groundwater assessments conducted will be made available via the
knowledge management platform to national policy-makers and project developers to improve the limited understanding of
groundwater systems and upscale sustainable integrated water resource management techniques in Djibouti. Output 3.3
will further manage the impacts of surface water on downstream areas by protecting against flood damage and erosion.
Methods for preventing floods may include infiltration galleries[2]111 and gabions. Site-specific interventions will be
determined based on the topography and community-specific impacts identified during the PPG phase. To build on the
limited water resource management information in the country, the proposed project will support gender-responsive,
evidence-based development by producing assessments on: i) sustainable groundwater access points; ii) surface and sub-
surface storage and catchment points; and iii) rangeland and oasis ecosystems restoration. [/INST]  Based on the provided document chunk, here is the analysis related to the issue of water management:
